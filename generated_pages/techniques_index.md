<td>Leverage Existing Narratives</td>
<td>Use or adapt existing narrative themes, where narratives are the baseline stories of a target audience. Narratives form the bedrock of our worldviews. New information is understood through a process firmly grounded in this bedrock. If new information is not consitent with the prevailing narratives of an audience, it will be ignored. Effective campaigns will frame their misinformation in the context of these narratives. Highly effective campaigns will make extensive use of audience-appropriate archetypes and meta-narratives throughout their content creation and amplifiction practices. </td>

<td>Develop Competing Narratives</td>
<td>Advance competing narratives connected to same issue ie: on one hand deny incident while at same time expresses dismiss. Suppressing or discouraging narratives already spreading requires an alternative. The most simple set of narrative techniques in response would be the construction and promotion of contradictory alternatives centered on denial, deflection, dismissal, counter-charges, excessive standards of proof, bias in prohibition or enforcement, and so on. These competing narratives allow loyalists cover, but are less compelling to opponents and fence-sitters than campaigns built around existing narratives or highly explanatory master narratives. Competing narratives, as such, are especially useful in the "firehose of misinformation" approach.</td>

<td>Create Inauthentic Social Media Pages and Groups</td>
<td>Create key social engineering assets needed to amplify content, manipulate algorithms, fool public and/or specific incident/campaign targets. Computational propaganda depends substantially on false perceptions of credibility and acceptance. By creating fake users and groups with a variety of interests and commitments, attackers can ensure that their messages both come from trusted sources and appear more widely adopted than they actually are.</td>

<td>Cultivate ignorant agents</td>
<td>Cultivate propagandists for a cause, the goals of which are not fully comprehended, and who are used cynically by the leaders of the cause. Independent actors use social media and specialised web sites to strategically reinforce and spread messages compatible with their own. Their networks are infiltrated and used by state media disinformation organisations to amplify the state’s own disinformation strategies against target populations. Many are traffickers in conspiracy theories or hoaxes, unified by a suspicion of Western governments and mainstream media. Their narratives, which appeal to leftists hostile to globalism and military intervention and nationalists against immigration, are frequently infiltrated and shaped by state-controlled trolls and altered news items from agencies such as RT and Sputnik. Also know as "useful idiots" or "unwitting agents".</td>

<td>Create hashtags and search artifacts</td>
<td>Create one or more hashtags and/or hashtag groups. Many incident-based campaigns will create hashtags to promote their fabricated event. Creating a hashtag for an incident can have two important effects: 1. Create a perception of reality around an event. Certainly only "real" events would be discussed in a hashtag. After all, the event has a name!, and 2. Publicize the story more widely through trending lists and search behavior. Asset needed to direct/control/manage "conversation" connected to launching new incident/campaign with new hashtag for applicable social media sites). </td>

<td>Leverage Conspiracy Theory Narratives</td>
<td>"Conspiracy narratives" appeal to the human desire for explanatory order, by invoking the participation of poweful (often sinister) actors in pursuit of their own political goals. These narratives are especially appealing when an audience is low-information, marginalized or otherwise inclined to reject the prevailing explanation. Conspiracy narratives are an important component of the "firehose of falsehoods" model. </td>

<td>Amplify Existing Conspiracy Theory Narratives</td>
<td>An influence operation may amplify an existing conspiracy theory narrative that aligns with its incident or campaign goals. By amplifying existing conspiracy theory narratives, operators can leverage the power of the existing communities that support and propagate those theories without needing to expend resources creating new narratives or building momentum and buy in around new narratives. </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="techniques/T0022.002.md">T0022.002</a></td>
<td>Develop Original Conspiracy Theory Narratives</td>
<td>While this requires more resources than amplifying existing conspiracy theory narratives, an influence operation may develop original conspiracy theory narratives in order to achieve greater control and alignment over the narrative and their campaign goals. Prominent examples include the USSR's Operation INFEKTION disinformation campaign run by the KGB in the 1980s to plant the idea that the United States had invented HIV/AIDS as part of a biological weapons research project at Fort Detrick, Maryland. More recently, Fort Detrick featured prominently in a new conspiracy theory narratives around the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak and pandemic. </td>

<tr>
<td><a href="techniques/T0023.002.md">T0023.002</a></td>
<td>Edit Open-Source Content</td>
<td>An influence operation may edit open-source content, such as collaborative blogs or  encyclopedias, to promote its narratives on outlets with existing credibility and audiences. Editing open-source content may allow an operation to post content on platforms without  dedicating resources to the creation and maintenance of its own assets. </td>

<td>TA07</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="techniques/T0039 .md">T0039 </a></td>
<td>Bait legitimate influencers</td>
<td>Credibility in a social media environment is often a function of the size of a user's network. "Influencers" are so-called because of their reach, typically understood as: 1) the size of their network (i.e. the number of followers, perhaps weighted by their own influence); and 2) The rate at which their comments are re-circulated (these two metrics are related). Add traditional media players at all levels of credibility and professionalism to this, and the number of potential influencial carriers available for unwitting amplification becomes substantial. By targeting high-influence people and organizations in all types of media with narratives and content engineered to appeal their emotional or ideological drivers, influence campaigns are able to add perceived credibility to their messaging via saturation and adoption by trusted agents such as celebrities, journalists and local leaders.</td>
<td>TA08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="techniques/T0040.md">T0040</a></td>
<td>Demand insurmountable proof</td>
<td>Campaigns often leverage tactical and informational asymmetries on the threat surface, as seen in the Distort and Deny strategies, and the "firehose of misinformation". Specifically, conspiracy theorists can be repeatedly wrong, but advocates of the truth need to be perfect. By constantly escalating demands for proof, propagandists can effectively leverage this asymmetry while also priming its future use, often with an even greater asymmetric advantage. The conspiracist is offered freer rein for a broader range of "questions" while the truth teller is burdened with higher and higher standards of proof.</td>
<td>TA14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="techniques/T0042.md">T0042</a></td>
<td>Seed Kernel of truth</td>
<td>Wrap lies or altered context/facts around truths. Influence campaigns pursue a variety of objectives with respect to target audiences, prominent among them: 1. undermine a narrative commonly referenced in the target audience; or 2. promote a narrative less common in the target audience, but preferred by the attacker. In both cases, the attacker is presented with a heavy lift. They must change the relative importance of various narratives in the interpretation of events, despite contrary tendencies. When messaging makes use of factual reporting to promote these adjustments in the narrative space, they are less likely to be dismissed out of hand; when messaging can juxtapose a (factual) truth about current affairs with the (abstract) truth explicated in these narratives, propagandists can undermine or promote them selectively. Context matters.</td>

<td>Bots Amplify via Automated Forwarding and Reposting</td>
<td>Automated forwarding and reposting refer to the proliferation of operation content using  automated means, such as artificial intelligence or social media bots. An influence operation may  use automated activity to increase content exposure without dedicating the resources, including  personnel and time, traditionally required to forward and repost content. 
Use bots to amplify narratives above algorithm thresholds. Bots are automated/programmed profiles designed to amplify content (ie: automatically retweet or like) and give appearance it's more "popular" than it is. They can operate as a network, to function in a coordinated/orchestrated manner. In some cases (more so now) they are an inexpensive/disposable assets used for minimal deployment as bot detection tools improve and platforms are more responsive.</td>

<td>Utilize Spamoflauge</td>
<td>Spamoflauge refers to the practice of disguising spam messages as legitimate. Spam refers to  the use of electronic messaging systems to send out unrequested or unwanted messages in bulk.  Simple methods of spamoflauge include replacing letters with numbers to fool keyword-based  email spam filters, for example, "you've w0n our jackp0t!". Spamoflauge may extend to more complex techniques such as modifying the grammar or word choice of the language, casting  messages as images which spam detectors cannot automatically read, or encapsulating messages  in password protected attachments, such as .pdf or .zip files. Influence operations may use spamoflauge to avoid spam filtering systems and increase the likelihood of the target audience  receiving operation messaging. </td>

Data voids are hard to detect and relatively harmless until exploited by an entity  aiming to quickly proliferate false or misleading information during a phenomenon that causes a  high number of individuals to query the term or phrase. In the Plan phase, an influence operation  may identify data voids for later exploitation in the operation.  
A 2019 report by Michael Golebiewski identifies five types of data voids. (1) “Breaking news”  data voids occur when a keyword gains popularity during a short period of time, allowing an  influence operation to publish false content before legitimate news outlets have an opportunity to  publish relevant information. (2) An influence operation may create a “strategic new terms” data  void by creating their own terms and publishing information online before promoting their  keyword to the target audience. (3) An influence operation may publish content on “outdated  terms” that have decreased in popularity, capitalizing on most search engines’ preferences for  recency. (4) “Fragmented concepts” data voids separate connections between similar ideas,  isolating segment queries to distinct search engine results. (5) An influence operation may use  “problematic queries” that previously resulted in disturbing or inappropriate content to promote  messaging until mainstream media recontextualizes the term.  </td>

An operation may  create these isolated areas of the internet by match existing groups, or aggregating individuals  into a single target audience based on shared interests, politics, values, demographics, and other  characteristics. Echo chambers and filter bubbles help to reinforce similar biases and content to  the same target audience members. </td>

<td>Exploit Data Voids</td>
<td>A data void refers to a word or phrase that results in little, manipulative, or low-quality search  engine data. Data voids are hard to detect and relatively harmless until exploited by an entity  aiming to quickly proliferate false or misleading information during a phenomenon that causes a  high number of individuals to query the term or phrase. In the Plan phase, an influence operation  may identify data voids for later exploitation in the operation.  
A 2019 report by Michael Golebiewski identifies five types of data voids. (1) “Breaking news”  data voids occur when a keyword gains popularity during a short period of time, allowing an  influence operation to publish false content before legitimate news outlets have an opportunity to  publish relevant information. (2) An influence operation may create a “strategic new terms” data  void by creating their own terms and publishing information online before promoting their  keyword to the target audience. (3) An influence operation may publish content on “outdated  terms” that have decreased in popularity, capitalizing on most search engines’ preferences for  recency. (4) “Fragmented concepts” data voids separate connections between similar ideas,  isolating segment queries to distinct search engine results. (5) An influence operation may use  “problematic queries” that previously resulted in disturbing or inappropriate content to promote  messaging until mainstream media recontextualizes the term.  </td>

<td>Conceal Sponsorship</td>
<td>Concealing sponsorship aims to mislead or obscure the identity of the hidden sponsor behind an operation rather than entity publicly running the operation. Operations that conceal sponsorship  may maintain visible falsified groups, news outlets, non-profits, or other organizations, but seek  to mislead or obscure the identity sponsoring, funding, or otherwise supporting these entities.  
Influence operations may use a variety of techniques to mask the location of their social media  accounts to complicate attribution and conceal evidence of foreign interference. Operation  accounts may set their location to a false place, often the location of the operation’s target  audience, and post in the region’s language</td>

<td>Utilize Bulletproof Hosting</td>
<td>Hosting refers to services through which storage and computing resources are provided to an  individual or organization for the accommodation and maintenance of one or more websites and  related services. Services may include web hosting, file sharing, and email distribution.  Bulletproof hosting refers to services provided by an entity, such as a domain hosting or web  hosting firm, that allows its customer considerable leniency in use of the service. An influence  operation may utilize bulletproof hosting to maintain continuity of service for suspicious, illegal,  or disruptive operation activities that stricter hosting services would limit, report, or suspend. </td>
