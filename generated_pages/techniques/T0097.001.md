# Technique T0097.001: Produce Evidence for Persona

* **Summary**: People may produce evidence which supports the persona they are deploying (T0097) (aka “backstopping” the persona).

This Technique covers situations where evidence is developed or produced as part of an influence operation to increase the perceived legitimacy of a persona used during IO, including creating accounts for the same persona on multiple platforms.

The use of personas (T0097), and providing evidence to improve people’s perception of one’s persona (T0097.001), are not necessarily malicious or inauthentic. However, sometimes people use personas to increase the perceived legitimacy of narratives for malicious purposes.

This Technique was previously called Backstop Personas.

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA16
