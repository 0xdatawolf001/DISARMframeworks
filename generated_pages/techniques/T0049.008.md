# Technique T0049.008: Generate Information Pollution

* **Summary**: Information Pollution occurs when threat actors attempt to ruin a source of information by flooding it with lots of inauthentic or unreliable content, intending to make it harder for legitimate users to find the information they’re looking for. 

This subtechnique's objective is to reduce exposure to target information, rather than promoting exposure to campaign content, for which the parent technique T0049 can be used. 

Analysts will need to infer what the motive for flooding an information space was when deciding whether to use T0049 or T0049.008 to tag a case when an information space is flooded. If such inference is not possible, default to T0049.

This Technique previously used the ID T0019.

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA17
