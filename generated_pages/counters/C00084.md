# Counter C00084: Modify disinformation narratives, and rebroadcast them

* **Summary**: Includes “poison pill recasting of message” and “steal their truths”.  Many techniques involve promotion which could be manipulated. For example, online fundings or rallies could be advertised, through compromised or fake channels, as being associated with "far-up/down/left/right" actors. "Long Game" narratives could be subjected in a similar way with negative connotations.  Can also replay technique T0003.
