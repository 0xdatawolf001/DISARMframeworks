# Counter C00070: Block access to disinformation resources

* **Summary**: Resources = accounts, channels etc.  Block access to platform. DDOS an attacker.

TA02*: DDOS at the critical time (ie. midterm-2018 elections DDOS against troll farms) to deny an adversary's time-bound objective.

T0008: A quick response to a proto-viral story will affect it's ability to spread and raise questions about their legitimacy.

Hashtag: Against the platform, by drowning the hashtag.

T0046 - Search Engine Optimization: Sub-optimal website performance affect its search engine rank, which I interpret as "blocking access to a platform".

* **Playbooks**: 

* **Metatechnique**: M005 - removal

* **Resources needed:** 

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA02
