Threat actors can fabricate news organisations (T0143.002: Fabricated Persona, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona), or they can impersonate existing news outlets (T0143.003: Impersonated Persona, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br> Legitimate news organisations could use their persona for malicious purposes, or be exploited by threat actors (T0143.001: Authentic Persona, T0097.202: News Outlet Persona).<br><br> <b>Associated Techniques and Sub-techniques</b></br> <b>T0097.102: Journalist Persona:</b> Institutions presenting as news outlets may also present journalists working within the organisation.<br> <b>T0097.201: Local Institution Persona:</b> Institutions presenting as news outlets may present as being a local news outlet.<br> <b>T0097.203: Fact Checking Organisation Persona:</b> Institutions presenting as news outlets may also deliver a fact checking service (e.g. The UK\u2019s BBC News has the fact checking service BBC Verify). When an actor presents as the fact checking arm of a news outlet, they are presenting both a News Outlet Persona and a Fact Checking Organisation Persona.",
