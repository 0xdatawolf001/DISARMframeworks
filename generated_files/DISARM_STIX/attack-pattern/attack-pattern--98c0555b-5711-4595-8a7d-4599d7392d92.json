            "description": "Opinion articles (aka \u201cOp-Eds\u201d or \u201cEditorials\u201d) are articles or regular columns flagged as \u201copinion\u201d posted to news sources, and can be contributed by people outside the organisation.\u00a0<br /> <br />Flagging articles as opinions allow news organisations to distinguish them from the typical expectations of objective news reporting while distancing the presented opinion from the organisation or its employees.<br /> <br /> The use of this technique is not by itself an indication of malicious or inauthentic content; Op-eds are a common format in media. However, threat actors exploit op-eds to, for example, submit opinion articles to local media to promote their narratives. <br /> <br />Examples from the perspective of a news site involve publishing op-eds from perceived prestigious voices to give legitimacy to an inauthentic publication, or supporting causes by hosting op-eds from actors aligned with the organisation\u2019s goals.",
