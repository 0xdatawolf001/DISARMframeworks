            "description": "An influence operation may hire trolls, or human operators of fake accounts that aim to provoke  others by posting and amplifying content about controversial issues. Trolls can serve to discredit  an influence operation\u2019s opposition or bring attention to the operation\u2019s cause through debate.  \nClassic trolls refer to regular people who troll for personal reasons, such as attention-seeking or  boredom. Classic trolls may advance operation narratives by coincidence but are not directly  affiliated with any larger operation. Conversely, hybrid trolls act on behalf of another institution, such as a state or financial organization, and post content with a specific ideological  goal. Hybrid trolls may be highly advanced and institutionalized or less organized and work for a  single individual. ",
