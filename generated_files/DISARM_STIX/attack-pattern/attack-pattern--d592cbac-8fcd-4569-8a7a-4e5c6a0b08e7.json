            "description": "Parody is a form of artistic expression that imitates the style or characteristics of a particular work, genre, or individual in a humorous or satirical way, often to comment on or critique the original work or subject matter. People may present as parodies to create humour or make a point by exaggerating or altering elements of the original, while still maintaining recognizable elements.<br><br> The use of parody is not an indication of inauthentic or malicious behaviour; parody allows people to present ideas or criticisms in a comedic or exaggerated manner, softening the impact of sensitive or contentious topics. Because parody is often protected as a form of free speech or artistic expression, it provides a legal and social framework for discussing controversial issues.<br><br> However, parody personas may be perceived as authentic personas, leading to people mistakenly believing that a parody account\u2019s statements represent the real opinions of a parodied target. Threat actors may also use the guise of parody to spread campaign content. Parody personas may disclaim that they are operating as a parody, however this is not always the case, and is not always given prominence.<br><br> <b>Associated Techniques and Sub-techniques</b> <b>T0097: Presented Persona: </b>Analysts can use the sub-techniques of T0097: Presented Persona to categorise the type of parody.\u00a0For example, an account presenting as a parody of a business could be documented using T0097.205: Business Persona and T0143.003: Parody Persona.<br> <b>T0145.001: Copy Account Imagery:</b> Actors may take existing accounts\u2019 profile pictures as part of their parody efforts.",
