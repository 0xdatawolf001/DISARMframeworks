They can also conduct DDOS attacks and other offensive cyber operations, aiming to take down digital assets or gain access to proprietary information. An influence operation may use hacktivist personas to support their operational narratives and legitimise their operational activities.<br><br>Fabricated Hacktivists are sometimes referred to as \u201cFaketivists\u201d.<br><br><b>Associated Techniques and Sub-techniques</b><br><b>T0097.103: Activist Persona:</b> Analysts should use this sub-technique to catalogue cases where an individual is presenting themselves as someone engaged in activism but doesn\u2019t present themselves as using technical tools and methods to achieve their goals.",
