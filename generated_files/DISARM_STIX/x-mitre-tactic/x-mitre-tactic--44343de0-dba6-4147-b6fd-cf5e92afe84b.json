For assets under their direct control, the operation can add,  change, or remove these assets at will.  \nEstablishing information assets allows an influence operation to promote messaging directly to  the target audience without navigating through external entities. Many online influence operations create or compromise social media accounts as a primary vector of information  dissemination.",
