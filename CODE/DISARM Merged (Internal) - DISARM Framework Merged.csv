In the Plan phase, an influence operation  may identify data voids for later exploitation in the operation.  
A 2019 report by Michael Golebiewski identifies five types of data voids. (1) “Breaking news”  data voids occur when a keyword gains popularity during a short period of time, allowing an  influence operation to publish false content before legitimate news outlets have an opportunity to  publish relevant information. (2) An influence operation may create a “strategic new terms” data  void by creating their own terms and publishing information online before promoting their  keyword to the target audience. (3) An influence operation may publish content on “outdated  terms” that have decreased in popularity, capitalizing on most search engines’ preferences for  recency. (4) “Fragmented concepts” data voids separate connections between similar ideas,  isolating segment queries to distinct search engine results.

An  influence operation may use bots to increase its exposure and artificially promote its content  across the internet without dedicating additional time or human resources.  
Amplifier bots promote operation content through reposts, shares, and likes to increase the  content’s online popularity. Hacker bots are traditionally covert bots running on computer  scripts that rarely engage with users and work primarily as agents of larger cyberattacks, such as  a Distributed Denial of Service attacks.

167,Execute,Conduct Pump Priming,Bait legitimate influencers,n/a,"Credibility in a social media environment is often a function of the size of a user's network. ""Influencers"" are so-called because of their reach, typically understood as: 1) the size of their network (i.e. the number of followers, perhaps weighted by their own influence); and 2) The rate at which their comments are re-circulated (these two metrics are related). Add traditional media players at all levels of credibility and professionalism to this, and the number of potential influencial carriers available for unwitting amplification becomes substantial. By targeting high-influence people and organizations in all types of media with narratives and content engineered to appeal their emotional or ideological drivers, influence campaigns are able to add perceived credibility to their messaging via saturation and adoption by trusted agents such as celebrities, journalists and local leaders.",T0064,,,,AMITT,T0039 Bait legitimate influencers (AMITT)
168,Execute,Conduct Pump Priming,Seed Kernel of truth,n/a,"Wrap lies or altered context/facts around truths. Influence campaigns pursue a variety of objectives with respect to target audiences, prominent among them: 1. undermine a narrative commonly referenced in the target audience; or 2. promote a narrative less common in the target audience, but preferred by the attacker. In both cases, the attacker is presented with a heavy lift. They must change the relative importance of various narratives in the interpretation of events, despite contrary tendencies. When messaging makes use of factual reporting to promote these adjustments in the narrative space, they are less likely to be dismissed out of hand; when messaging can juxtapose a (factual) truth about current affairs with the (abstract) truth explicated in these narratives, propagandists can undermine or promote them selectively.
